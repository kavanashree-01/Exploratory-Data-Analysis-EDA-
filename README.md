*PROJECT DETAILS*:

Customer churn—when subscribers leave a service—is a critical challenge for telecom companies. Losing customers means losing revenue, and understanding why they leave can help businesses improve retention strategies. This project delves into a telecom customer dataset to uncover patterns behind customer churn, enabling businesses to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures.

What Does the Data Tell Us?
The dataset includes 7,043 customers, tracking their demographics, subscription details, billing methods, and whether they churned. By analyzing this data, we can answer key questions:

Who is leaving? Are certain age groups, genders, or household types more likely to churn?

Why are they leaving? Is it due to high costs, contract flexibility, or service dissatisfaction?

When do they leave? Do customers churn early, or after years of service?

For telecom companies, preventing churn is cheaper than acquiring new customers. By identifying high-risk groups—like month-to-month subscribers or fiber optic users—businesses can:

Offer incentives (discounts, upgrades) to retain at-risk customers.

Encourage automatic payments to reduce friction.

Improve service quality for high-churn segments like fiber optic users.

Final Thoughts
This analysis isn’t just about numbers—it’s about understanding customer behavior. By recognizing patterns in churn, telecom companies can tailor retention strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately reduce lost revenue. The next step? Building a predictive model to flag customers likely to churn before they leave.
